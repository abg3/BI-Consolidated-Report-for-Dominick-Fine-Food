Dominickâ€™s Fine Food (DFF) is a grocery store chain and subsidiary of Safeway Inc. with locations mainly in the Chicago area. We are planning to design and develop a data warehouse for this retail store chain. The data is collected from the DFF database from Chicago Booth which consists of 25 product categories in over 100 retail chain stores. Given these important data files, such as customer, location, and sale information, we would generate a bunch of tables with attributes that help managers to make decisions regarding product sales.
